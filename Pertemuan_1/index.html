    <h1>University Of Oxford</h1>
    <p>The University of Oxford is a collegiate research university in Oxford, England. There is evidence of teaching as early as 1096, making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world's second-oldest university in continuous operation. It grew rapidly from 1167, when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris. After disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk, some Oxford academics fled northeast to Cambridge, where they established the University of Cambridge in 1209. The two English ancient universities share many common features and are jointly referred to as Oxbridge. <br> Oxford is an independent and self-governing institution consisting of the University, its divisions, departments and faculties, and the colleges. Oxford has been ranked first in the ranking conducted by the Times Good University Guide for eleven consecutive years, and is second in the ranking of The Guardian in 2013
